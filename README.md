To make changes to the styling, you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To install dependencies, run:
```bash

```

Sass is used as the css pre-processor. To compile to css, run:
```bash
$ npm run compile:sass
```

Alternatively, to watch for file changes, run:
```bash
$ npm run compile:sass:watch
```

To serve locally, install live-server, then run the develop script:
